        Understanding the Different Types of AFP Checks: Standard vs. Nationally Coordinated
    </p>
    <p>
        When it comes to background checks in Australia, the Australian Federal Police (AFP) Check is a common requirement, particularly for roles in sensitive industries or those involving vulnerable populations. However, not all AFP Checks are the same. Understanding the differences between a "standard" AFP Check and a "nationally coordinated" AFP Check is crucial for employers to ensure they are meeting their legal obligations and conducting appropriate due diligence. This article will break down the distinctions between these two check types, helping you choose the right check for your specific needs and ensure your background check processes are compliant.
    </p>
    <h2 class="fw-bolder">
        The Basics: What is an AFP Check?
    </h2>
    <p>
        Before we delve into the types, let's recap what an AFP Check is. Generally, it's a search of police records across Australia to identify an individual's criminal history. This check is used to provide a comprehensive overview of any disclosable court outcomes or pending charges, helping employers make informed decisions about a candidate’s suitability for a role. However, the scope of the search and the level of detail can differ between a standard check and a nationally coordinated check.
    </p>
    <h2 class="fw-bolder">
        Standard AFP Check: A Limited Scope
    </h2>
    <p>
        The term "standard" AFP Check is sometimes used informally and can be a source of confusion, as the AFP themselves do not officially refer to a check as "standard". However, when the term is used, it generally means a check is focused on specific criteria, and often, they are based on previous police records held by the AFP, or a defined scope. These types of checks may involve:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <span class="fw-bolder">
                Specific Timeframe:
            </span> It may only review records from a certain timeframe (e.g. the past 5 years)
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="fw-bolder">
                Specific Location:
            </span> The check may be focused on an individual’s criminal record within a certain jurisdiction, rather than a national search.
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="fw-bolder">
                Specific Offences:
            </span> It may be limited to looking for certain types of criminal offences, based on relevance.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="fw-bolder">
        When is a Standard AFP Check Typically Used?
    </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <span class="fw-bolder">
                Specific Requirements:
            </span> When a specific piece of legislation or policy stipulates a check with a defined criteria.
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="fw-bolder">
                Internal Policies:
            </span> Some organisations may use a standard AFP check, with a defined criteria, as part of their own internal policies.
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="fw-bolder">
                Specific Roles:
            </span> When a role is not considered highly sensitive, and an overview of limited criminal history is required.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        It's important to note that the limitations of a ‘standard’ check can mean that they may not meet the requirements for certain roles or industries that have stricter obligations.
    </p>
    <h2 class="fw-bolder">
        Nationally Coordinated AFP Check: A Comprehensive Search
    </h2>
    <p>
        A nationally coordinated police check, often simply referred to as an AFP Check, is a more comprehensive screening process. This type of check searches the criminal history records across all police jurisdictions in Australia, and includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <span class="fw-bolder">
                National Database Search:
            </span> It searches the records of all Australian states and territories, ensuring no relevant records are missed.
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="fw-bolder">
                No Timeframe Limit:
            </span> The search is not limited to a set timeframe. All disclosable court outcomes or pending charges will be detailed on the result.
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="fw-bolder">
                All Disclosable Offences:
            </span> The check encompasses all relevant disclosable criminal records, without limitation.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="fw-bolder">
        When is a Nationally Coordinated AFP Check Required?
    </h2>
    <p>
        A nationally coordinated check is generally the required check type and is usually mandated in:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <span class="fw-bolder">
                High-Risk Industries:
            </span> Sectors such as healthcare, education, childcare, aged care, and finance frequently require this check type due to the nature of the work and the vulnerabilities of the people they serve.
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="fw-bolder">
                Working with Vulnerable People:
            </span> Roles that involve regular interaction with children, the elderly, or individuals with disabilities.
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="fw-bolder">
                Roles with Sensitive Information:
            </span> Positions that access personal data, confidential company information, or intellectual property.
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="fw-bolder">
                Financial Roles:
            </span> Roles where an employee manages large sums of money or is involved in financial transactions.
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="fw-bolder">
                Government and Public Sector:
            </span> Many government roles require a higher level of security clearance, necessitating a nationally coordinated check.
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="fw-bolder">
                Visa and Immigration:
            </span> Some visa and immigration applications require a nationally coordinated AFP check as part of the assessment process.
        </li>
    </ul>
